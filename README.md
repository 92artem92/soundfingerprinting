## Sound Fingerprinting

Soundfingerprinting is a C# framework designed for developers and researchers in the fields of audio processing, data mining, digital signal processing.  It implements an efficient algorithm of signal processing which will allow one to have a competent system of audio fingerprinting and signal recognition.

See the [Wiki page](https://github.com/AddictedCS/soundfingerprinting/wiki) with the operational details and information 

The framework is provided under [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licence agreement.

The framework implements the algorithm from [Content Fingerprinting Using Wavelets](http://www.nhchau.com/files/cvmp_BalujaCovell.A4color.pdf) paper.

My description of the algorithm can be found on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/206507/Duplicates-detector-via-audio-fingerprinting) 

Feel free to contact project owners for any offers, remarks, ideas, etc.
