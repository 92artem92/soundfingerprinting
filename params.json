{"name":"Sound Fingerprinting","tagline":"The project aims studying the audio signal in terms of its perceptual characteristics, resulting in an algorithm that will be able to detect unknown audio snippets from a large database of known songs. ","body":"Soundfingerprinting, Ciumac Sergiu\r\n\r\nSoundfingerprinting is a C# framework designed for developers and researchers in the fields of audio processing, data mining, digital signal processing. It implements an efficient algorithm of signal processing which will allow one to have a competent system of audio fingerprinting and signal recognition.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact project owners for any offers, remarks, ideas, etc.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AddictedCS/soundfingerprinting/wiki\">Wiki</a> page with the details.\r\n\r\nThe framework is provided under <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">GPLv3 licence agreement</a>.\r\n\r\nThe framework implements the algorithm from <a href=\"http://www.nhchau.com/files/cvmp_BalujaCovell.A4color.pdf\">Content Fingerprinting Using Wavelets</a> paper.\r\n\r\nMy description of the algorithm can be found <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/206507/Duplicates-detector-via-audio-fingerprinting\">here</a>\r\n\r\nCopyright, Soundfingerprinting, 2010-2013, ciumac.sergiu@gmail.com","google":"UA-41485449-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
